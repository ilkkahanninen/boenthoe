# Boenthoe

Rust demo engine. The first proof-of-concept demo is built with this engine (just compile and run the master). Lots and lots are going to change.

Next steps:

- Rewrite and simplify rendering pipeline creation.
- Own script language (BoenthoeScript a.k.a. bäsä) for setting parametrizable parts of demos.
- Hot-reload for script and assets.
- glTF or Collada support with animations.
- DRY API to provide uniforms to shaders.
- Multi-platform support: Windows, OSX, Linux and maybe web.

## Requirements

- [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
